### Hi there, I'm Asss_whom! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of Traditional Chinese Medicine with a passion for coding and development. Although I am currently focused on my studies, I have a keen interest in programming and enjoy exploring different programming languages and technologies.

**Languages:** R & Python

**Projects:** Currently, I don't have any projects on my Github profile. However, I am eager to start working on exciting projects in the future.

**Open Source Contributions:** I haven't made any open source contributions or actively participated in any communities yet. However, I am looking forward to getting involved and contributing to the open source community in the future.

**Skills and Interests:** Apart from programming, I have a diverse range of skills and interests. As a student of Traditional Chinese Medicine, I have a deep understanding of holistic health practices and natural remedies. I also enjoy exploring various forms of art and creative expression.

Feel free to connect with me on Github and reach out if you have any interesting projects or collaborations to discuss!
