### Hi there, I'm Asss_whom! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of Traditional Chinese Medicine with a passion for coding and development. Although I am currently focused on my studies, I have a keen interest in programming and enjoy exploring different programming languages and technologies.

**Languages:** Always Python, sometimes other language. 

Feel free to connect with me on Github and reach out if you have any interesting projects or collaborations to discuss!
